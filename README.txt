To my hermanos m1 and m2,

Wewl... I have cheated. It is the verdad. I decided that since our names (Mark, Michael, and Matthew Gismondi) all add up to say "A mark of completion which is like unto God as His gift unto the world" then we should collaborate on something that is worthy of that designation bestowed upon us.

Ves? 

I have so much inspiration from the Holy Spirit that it gets overwhelming and 10s-2 come out as a giant mess which is kind of appropriate since that was one of mom's favorite nicknames for me when I was little. Mr. Messy. And so since you both have better histories with finished works, be it a published book or the collection of stories in red (interestingly this text is colored red as I type it which has something to do with being Github markdown even though I gave the file a .txt extension), and since my successes have mostly been entirely visual, it would be the cat's pajamas and the bees knees if we could honor our father and mother with a post-mortem blessing of collaboration. 

If you only knew how much the Holy Spirit has cheated in various maneras in every place I have been, a group of older women that I kid you not look like Aunt Sara, Aunt Elinor, Grandma, Aunt Cat, Marie Sibley, for example which have been incredibly helpful and comforting to me in these situations (the fish aunts!) then you might be inspired as well. I so desperately want to take photos with them and send you just so you can see(s). There is even a guy named Cecil that I keep telling, "CEASE!" to. And I kid you not the last few nights, King Lance showed up with his son Emilio. SOBAD! 

And then there are the people who keep saying, "Kay Kay" which I finally realized was their attempt to pronounce KK. As in, "YOU CHEATED! Kk." 

Kkkk. 

But never just three. 

And then there is the guy who looks exactly like an older pervy version of my friend Don from college. And he keeps making really horribly offensive comments to me. 

A Bad Don. 

Or Apollyon in Greek, apparently. 

And then the group of people that look like baby seals that make me want to say, "AAEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!" There are about seven of them. And a bunch of other people who want to look like baby seals but menojan and make me want to club them. 

Oh that is so bad. 

Kkkkkkk.

But the most precious of all is the Ma Terial Witnesses. They look like Ma and Terial.

The Book of Revelation cheats in ways that might not surprise you! Peez be my friend and hewp. I want to take all of the things that this various cheat footage has been demonstrating and organize it into something that explains the deeper and awesome background concepts that are referred to all throughout the Bible but have been completely lost from our understanding. The most obvious one that comes to mind at the moment is the concept of spiritual politics which is why it is no surprise to me that you are experts in political science and linguistics. 

But also the design of the temple in Ezekiel that was never built. If you look at all the photos and illustrations from the temple that Solomon built, the style is very Assyrian which always confused me. And then the other night I found myself talking to someone who was identified by someone else as the King of Assyria. And that same day I had been reading the passage from Isaiah 8 about that same king. 

I know why King Arthur had a round table. I'm just not sure how he fit every principality in the world around that table. Humankind created a political system of the world that is a mess and burdened by so much red tape and stupidity that it is mind-numbing. But God established His system around the House of David which involves representation based on geography. Geographical thrones, like mountains, which do not change no matter how the human designated boundaries grow and shrink. Mount Everest has an angel, for example, and the reason why humans started throwing people into volcanos was because they knew there was some divine cognizance involved in doing things like that. In other words, they knew that if they prayed to God or pleased Him, then they would be more likely to be spared. The problem is that it was too easy to start to see the mountain itself as a god because there was an angel there who God had delegated for that particular throne. And over time, some of those angels became frustrated with the situation of having to figure out how to deal with the good intentions of people who thought they were supposed to offer human sacrifices in the name of a different god. When the relief for their frustration was to let your volcano erupt and destroy everything around it, for example, or to let go of the burden of keeping a fault line from slipping, you can start to see the truth and reality of so many silly things like Wuponi Wu and orange soda.

God already designed a perfect political system that is at the core of all of this. The Founding Fathers understood the same concept and designed our country around it. I believe that was the original secrecy involved in early Freemasonry. But every time something comes along that rediscovers these concepts, one of those three pesky intruders jumps in trying to figure it out and make it work without God and the whole thing turns into something evil. The Knights Templar. The Illuminati. The Freemasons. 

But not the Gismondis. Because it's not just Tuesday. It's not just Wednesday. It's Gismondi.

For a long time I have been tortured by people talking about sucking d**k. In fact, for a while that even became a nickname that people would use to identify me. Suckadi**. Then I realized it was because they thought that I was related to the world political system which is polluted by the Vatican. Then I realized that it was related to the Vatican and the giant phallic symbol right in the middle of St. Peter's Square. Then I just now realized that it is like a giant knife aimed at God. The Holy Spirit is like the big mama bear that mauled the children who made fun of Elijah. If God the Father is in Heaven, then the Holy Spirit is the Mother on Earth. 

Don't give mom a knife. 

I didn't even realize that until just now. I am every day in awe of how every single bit of cheating that we ever did is becoming relevant in a very real and epic way. 

And (me doy herbst) that is how we will not be thwarted. Because this time the Holy Spirit cheated so bad that the enemy is confused to the point of delerium. They cannot make any sense of the cheating that we have done all our lives. 

Cherry. 

Kk.
