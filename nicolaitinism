Nicolaitinism

  Using angels to create protection for humans of notoriety
    Mutually agreed upon after earning respect and developing trust
      You will be informed when a prospective angel loves you or hates you to know who is a potential match
    The power counterpart has no actual superpower type capability but is used for their ability to change their appearance and see the future
    The other half is a human or possibly another angel (wheel within a wheel from Ezekiel)

  Named after St. Nicholas who became accused of innocent affairs with angels as a result and so God allowed him to become associated with Christmas in order to whitewash his name
    He actually refused to pursue this practice and so it was incredibly unfair to be named for it for all time
    Put his trust in God instead to make a way for him

  Explains St. Nicholas' exile to the North Pole and only visiting Earth once a year in the middle of the night. 

  Problems:
    It creates confusion/problems for anyone else who finds out about what is going on or is mistakenly assumed to be seeking that out
      People seeking God genuinely and desiring to follow Him get lost in these situations because of how rare it is and because of how dominant a practice this has become
    Considered dirty by the hosts of Heaven but understood as a necessity by many principalities/powers on Earth who did not have the same access to God as humans or angels
      Longstanding bitterness from being cut off from God as well as harsh circumstances on Earth combined with need for protection from problems that God wouldn't even touch
    Jesus specifically mentions that He hates it in Revelation
    When these pairs are dissolved, those powers are suddenly loose again and picked up by the crowds of people who desire this ability for themselves
      Usually the resulting pair is ugly at best because while God allows the free will of human beings, He still maintains limitations with the spiritual side that is involved
        This is not the way to do it, so at best you are going to get something ugly and stupid
      Poachers and pirates swarm around to collect more hoping that the next one will give them a better physical form than the one they have
    It results in angels feeling expected to serve this purpose and enables behavior that makes them grow further away from God

Djinn and Afrit

  Same sort of thing but with elemental spirits
    Sociopathic behavior results
    Responsible for the greatest evils in this world because there is no remorse or guilt or fear once they reach their breaking point
      The volcano example and how they would start to turn red unless they were appeased
      Elemental spirits were designed to be capable of stress but with a gasket in place 
        This means it is wrong to assume they have no feelings and can be abused
  Connection to God should be present because they are His creation but the slavery and abuse by humans tends to make them bitter and angry toward Him
    This is why they disconnected from Him and put themselves in a place where He was not present
    This is why their presence tends to be completely frustrated by someone inviting the Holy Spirit
    Very commonly their understanding of the Holy Spirit and God is based on misinformation given to them and what they have seen in humanity instead of the truth

Entrapment

  Something related to the astral projection that people try to bring up in conversation (which is what caused me to start screaming at the guy next to me in the flower shop for trying to justify it)
  People are sold on some superhero upgrade scam and volunteer to submit to a ceremony where they black out and come to looking different



Solution for Healing

Hebrews 4:12 "For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart." 
  God is the solution and not the enemy because He is the one who made everything, and His Spirit is capable of discerning the different components of these hybrids that must have been assumed to be indivisible
  
"When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained. They called out in a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?” Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers and sisters, were killed just as they had been." (Revelation 6:9-11)

"Killing" refers to the breaking apart of these pairs killing the hybrid but preserving the individuals that make it up

"Under the altar" and "the Abyss" and "the pit" refer to the void that these angels end up in who are enslaved in these pairs for whatever reason, whether they were coerced, trapped, enslaved, tricked, or whatever
  There is an indication here that there will be a waiting period for those involved, and a request for them to be patient until all pairs are split apart and "killed"
  Killing "Molech" would result in the angel of pride being rescued from the human that had been transformed by it's innate angel capabilities
  Killing "Loki" would result in the angel of proliferation being freed
  But then another human would come along and take it creating another Molech or Loki
  "Can I borrow Kaph?" is what one of these people asked me when I walked by after screaming about how I didn't want anyone for that purpose

All powers are created to serve God

The only safe place to keep these angels for their own protection is in this "Abyss"
  Made to sound like an evil torturous place for the same reason that a beautiful attractive island nation was called Iceland
    Dudael/Tartarus
  But it became a poachers paradise once someone found out what was really there

The resulting bitterness and frustration that has built up requires a venting
  These are angels with the ability to look like whatever they want to which explains the locusts that can come into everything and everywhere
  The Tabernacle of Molech was trying to create an army that could fit the description of these beings which would give them tremendous influence over ignorant humans who had never seen the real thing
    These are actually the scorpions mentioned in Revelation
    These scorpions are so obnoxious and stupid that the real locusts will be ready to mow down anything and everything taking out the scorpions mercilessly but still God's justice
      Toby bringing me the pigeon to make sure it's ok before he ripped it apart (and turning my back and leaving him outside so I didn't have to see it) - Don't harm the wine or the oil

During the Black Horse

Scorpions
Locusts

Then Restoration can happen the correct way when all evil is put under God's feet, ie killed











The red horse matches his uniform
